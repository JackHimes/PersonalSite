    <p>Hello and thank you for visting my website, my name is Jack Himes and I am a full stack developer. 
      I started my journey into the tech world in October 2021 by completing an intensive Java full stack development program.
      During my time there, I learned more than I ever thought I would.
      Some of the technologies I learned include: Java, JavaScript, mySQL, Spring Boot, RESTful APIs, Angular, HTML, CSS and more.
      As a full stack developer, I enjoy both front end and back end, however I notice I have an affinity for back end work.
      Since Graudating from the boot camp, I continue to educated myself with new technologies and honing my current skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to my journey into the IT industry, I obtained my B.S. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from Colorado State Univeristy.
      During this time, I had the amazing opportunity to work on multiple research teams, contributing some <a href="https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/full/10.1091/mbc.E20-05-0286" target="_blank">cool things</a>  to the scienfitifc and medical communities.
      My research experience was invalubale, however after college, I seeked a role with more hands-on work and pursued a career in the medical field.
      I got my EMT certification in 2019 and eventually worked at a Level II trauma center. I value and love my previous experiences, but I'm ready to transition to the world of software and web development.
      I thoroughly believe my previous work experiences have set me up to have a successful career as a developer and I am excited to see where my path leads!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I currently live in Frederick, Colorado with my wife, Emily and our dog, Gus. I was born and raised in the greater Denver area and love where I live.
      I am passionate about learning, technology, and science to improve the lives of others. I also love traveling, cooking, and trying new things!
    </p>

    <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
